# Lumbar-Spine-Segmentation
The lumbar spine plays a vital role in providing support, stability, and flexibility to the human body. Comprising five vertebrae (L1–L5) and intervertebral discs, the lumbar spine bears the weight of the upper body and facilitates movement. However, conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and degenerative diseases can significantly impact mobility and quality of life.<br>
<br><br>
However, manual segmentation is time-consuming, prone to human error, and requires significant expertise.<br><br><br>
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust lumbar spine segmentation system that:<br>
•	Accurately segments vertebrae and intervertebral discs from CT and MRI images.<br>
•	Handles variations in anatomy and imaging quality.<br>
•	Provides reliable outputs for clinical use or research purposes.
